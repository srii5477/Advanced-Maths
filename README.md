This is a project designed to be used for advanced mathematical calculations. I make use of the Newton API for more complex general computations as well as the NumPy library to delve deeper into more advanced mathematical computations. Clone this project, use 'npm i' to install the required dependencies and test it out! Feel free to create pull requests if you feel like you can add more to this project.
